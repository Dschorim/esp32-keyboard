# esp32-keyboard
This is an experimental keyboard firmware for the ESP32-S3.

Whilst the ESP32-S2 also comes with native usb support, this firmware is specifically designed for the ESP32-S3 and might or might not
work with the ESP32-S2.

The usb support is based on the [`tinyusb`](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) library.
